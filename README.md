# My init.lua
This is mostly for backup purposes as my config is very disorganized and I
don't recommend anyone take influence from it.
## Prerequisites
* Install [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
* Install yarn `npm i -g yarn` for `markdown-preview.nvim`
    * May also need to run `:call mkdp#util#install()` if markdown preview not
    showing up
* In Neovim run `:PlugInstall`
